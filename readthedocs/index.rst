What is this?
-------------

Telegram is a popular messaging application. This library is meant
to make it easy for you to write Python programs that can interact
with Telegram. Think of it as a wrapper that has already done the
heavy job for you, so you can focus on developing an application.


How should I use the documentation?
-----------------------------------

If you are getting started with the library, you should follow the
documentation in order by pressing the "Next" button at the bottom-right
of every page.

You can also use the menu on the left to quickly skip over sections.
