=============
Wall of Shame
=============


This project has an
`issues <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/issues>`__ section for
you to file **issues** whenever you encounter any when working with the
library. Said section is **not** for issues on *your* program but rather
issues with Telethon itself.

If you have not made the effort to 1. read through the docs and 2.
`look for the method you need <https://lonamiwebs.github.io/Telethon/>`__,
you will end up on the `Wall of
Shame <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3ARTFM+is%3Aclosed>`__,
i.e.Â all issues labeled
`"RTFM" <http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=RTFM>`__:

       **rtfm**
       Literally "Read The F--king Manual"; a term showing the
       frustration of being bothered with questions so trivial that the asker
       could have quickly figured out the answer on their own with minimal
       effort, usually by reading readily-available documents. People who
       say"RTFM!" might be considered rude, but the true rude ones are the
       annoying people who take absolutely no self-responibility and expect to
       have all the answers handed to them personally.

       *"Damn, that's the twelveth time that somebody posted this question
       to the messageboard today! RTFM, already!"*

       *by Bill M. July 27, 2004*

If you have indeed read the docs, and have tried looking for the method,
and yet you didn't find what you need, **that's fine**. Telegram's API
can have some obscure names at times, and for this reason, there is a
`"question"
label <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20label%3Aquestion%20>`__
with questions that are okay to ask. Just state what you've tried so
that we know you've made an effort, or you'll go to the Wall of Shame.

Of course, if the issue you're going to open is not even a question but
a real issue with the library (thankfully, most of the issues have been
that!), you won't end up here. Don't worry.
