Working with messages
=====================


.. note::

    These examples assume you have read :ref:`accessing-the-full-api`.


Forwarding messages
*******************

This request is available as a friendly method through
`client.forward_messages <telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.forward_messages>`,
and can be used like shown below:

    .. code-block:: python

        # If you only have the message IDs
        client.forward_messages(
            entity,  # to which entity you are forwarding the messages
            message_ids,  # the IDs of the messages (or message) to forward
            from_entity  # who sent the messages?
        )

        # If you have ``Message`` objects
        client.forward_messages(
            entity,  # to which entity you are forwarding the messages
            messages  # the messages (or message) to forward
        )

        # You can also do it manually if you prefer
        from telethon.tl.functions.messages import ForwardMessagesRequest

        messages = foo()  # retrieve a few messages (or even one, in a list)
        from_entity = bar()
        to_entity = baz()

        client(ForwardMessagesRequest(
            from_peer=from_entity,  # who sent these messages?
            id=[msg.id for msg in messages],  # which are the messages?
            to_peer=to_entity  # who are we forwarding them to?
        ))

The named arguments are there for clarity, although they're not needed because
they appear in order. You can obviously just wrap a single message on the list
too, if that's all you have.


Searching Messages
*******************

Messages are searched through the obvious SearchRequest_, but you may run
into issues_. A valid example would be:

    .. code-block:: python

        from telethon.tl.functions.messages import SearchRequest
        from telethon.tl.types import InputMessagesFilterEmpty

        filter = InputMessagesFilterEmpty()
        result = client(SearchRequest(
            peer=peer,      # On which chat/conversation
            q='query',      # What to search for
            filter=filter,  # Filter to use (maybe filter for media)
            min_date=None,  # Minimum date
            max_date=None,  # Maximum date
            offset_id=0,    # ID of the message to use as offset
            add_offset=0,   # Additional offset
            limit=10,       # How many results
            max_id=0,       # Maximum message ID
            min_id=0,       # Minimum message ID
            from_id=None    # Who must have sent the message (peer)
        ))

It's important to note that the optional parameter ``from_id`` could have
been omitted (defaulting to ``None``). Changing it to InputUserEmpty_, as one
could think to specify "no user", won't work because this parameter is a flag,
and it being unspecified has a different meaning.

If one were to set ``from_id=InputUserEmpty()``, it would filter messages
from "empty" senders, which would likely match no users.

If you get a ``ChatAdminRequiredError`` on a channel, it's probably because
you tried setting the ``from_id`` filter, and as the error says, you can't
do that. Leave it set to ``None`` and it should work.

As with every method, make sure you use the right ID/hash combination for
your ``InputUser`` or ``InputChat``, or you'll likely run into errors like
``UserIdInvalidError``.


Sending stickers
****************

Stickers are nothing else than ``files``, and when you successfully retrieve
the stickers for a certain sticker set, all you will have are ``handles`` to
these files. Remember, the files Telegram holds on their servers can be
referenced through this pair of ID/hash (unique per user), and you need to
use this handle when sending a "document" message. This working example will
send yourself the very first sticker you have:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Get all the sticker sets this user has
        sticker_sets = client(GetAllStickersRequest(0))

        # Choose a sticker set
        sticker_set = sticker_sets.sets[0]

        # Get the stickers for this sticker set
        stickers = client(GetStickerSetRequest(
            stickerset=InputStickerSetID(
                id=sticker_set.id, access_hash=sticker_set.access_hash
            )
        ))

        # Stickers are nothing more than files, so send that
        client(SendMediaRequest(
            peer=client.get_me(),
            media=InputMediaDocument(
                id=InputDocument(
                    id=stickers.documents[0].id,
                    access_hash=stickers.documents[0].access_hash
                )
            )
        ))
