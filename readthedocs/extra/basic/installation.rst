Automatic Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To install Telethon, simply do:

    ``pip install telethon``

If you get something like ``"SyntaxError: invalid syntax"`` or any other error while installing,
it's probably because ``pip`` defaults to Python 2, which is not supported. Use ``pip3`` instead.

If you already have the library installed, upgrade with:

    ``pip install --upgrade telethon``

You can also install the library directly from GitHub or a fork:

   .. code-block:: python

        # pip install git+https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon.git
        or
        $ git clone https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon.git
        $ cd Telethon/
        # pip install -Ue .

If you don't have root access, simply pass the ``--user`` flag to the pip command.


Manual Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Install the required ``pyaes`` (`GitHub`__ | `PyPi`__) and ``rsa`` (`GitHub`__ | `PyPi`__) modules:

    ``sudo -H pip install pyaes rsa``

2. Clone Telethon's GitHub repository: ``git clone https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon.git``

3. Enter the cloned repository: ``cd Telethon``

4. Run the code generator: ``python3 setup.py gen_tl``

5. Done!

To generate the documentation, ``cd docs`` and then ``python3 generate.py``.


Optional dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you're using the library under ARM (or even if you aren't),
you may want to install ``sympy`` through ``pip`` for a substantial speed-up
when generating the keys required to connect to Telegram
(you can of course do this on desktop too). See `issue #199`__ for more.

If ``libssl`` is available on your system, it will also be used wherever encryption is needed.

If neither of these are available, a pure Python callback will be used instead,
so you can still run the library wherever Python is available!
