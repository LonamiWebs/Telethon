============================
Tips for Porting the Project
============================


If you're going to use the code on this repository to guide you, please
be kind and don't forget to mention it helped you!

You should start by reading the source code on the `first
release <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/releases/tag/v0.1>`__ of
the project, and start creating a ``MtProtoSender``. Once this is made,
you should write by hand the code to authenticate on the Telegram's
server, which are some steps required to get the key required to talk to
them. Save it somewhere! Then, simply mimic, or reinvent other parts of
the code, and it will be ready to go within a few days.

Good luck!
