API Status
==========


In an attempt to help everyone who works with the Telegram API, the
library will by default report all *Remote Procedure Call* errors to
`RPC PWRTelegram <https://rpc.pwrtelegram.xyz/>`__, a public database
anyone can query, made by `Daniil <https://github.com/danog>`__. All the
information sent is a ``GET`` request with the error code, error message
and method used.

If you still would like to opt out, you can disable this feature by setting
``client.session.report_errors = False``. However Daniil would really thank
you if you helped him (and everyone) by keeping it on!
