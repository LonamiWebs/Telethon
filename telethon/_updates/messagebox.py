"""
This module deals with correct handling of updates, including gaps, and knowing when the code
should "get difference" (the set of updates that the client should know by now minus the set
of updates that it actually knows).

Each chat has its own [`Entry`] in the [`MessageBox`] (this `struct` is the "entry point").
At any given time, the message box may be either getting difference for them (entry is in
[`MessageBox::getting_diff_for`]) or not. If not getting difference, a possible gap may be
found for the updates (entry is in [`MessageBox::possible_gaps`]). Otherwise, the entry is
on its happy path.

Gaps are cleared when they are either resolved on their own (by waiting for a short time)
or because we got the difference for the corresponding entry.

While there are entries for which their difference must be fetched,
[`MessageBox::check_deadlines`] will always return [`Instant::now`], since "now" is the time
to get the difference.
