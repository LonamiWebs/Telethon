        Runs the event loop until the library is disconnected.

        It also notifies Telegram that we want to receive updates
        as described in https://core.telegram.org/api/updates.
        If an unexpected error occurs during update handling,
        the client will disconnect and said error will be raised.

        Manual disconnections can be made by calling `disconnect()
        <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.disconnect>`
        or sending a ``KeyboardInterrupt`` (e.g. by pressing ``Ctrl+C`` on
        the console window running the script).

        If a disconnection error occurs (i.e. the library fails to reconnect
        automatically), said error will be raised through here, so you have a
        chance to ``except`` it on your own code.

        If the loop is already running, this method returns a coroutine
        that you should await on your own code.

        .. note::

            If you want to handle ``KeyboardInterrupt`` in your code,
            simply run the event loop in your code too in any way, such as
            ``loop.run_forever()`` or ``await client.disconnected`` (e.g.
            ``loop.run_until_complete(client.disconnected)``).
