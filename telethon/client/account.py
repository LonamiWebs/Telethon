        Creates a proxy object over the current :ref:`TelegramClient` through
        which making requests will use :tl:`InvokeWithTakeoutRequest` to wrap
        them. In other words, returns the current client modified so that
        requests are done as a takeout:

        >>> from telethon.sync import TelegramClient
        >>>
        >>> with TelegramClient(...) as client:
        >>>     with client.takeout() as takeout:
        >>>         client.get_messages('me')  # normal call
        >>>         takeout.get_messages('me')  # wrapped through takeout

        Some of the calls made through the takeout session will have lower
        flood limits. This is useful if you want to export the data from
        conversations or mass-download media, since the rate limits will
        be lower. Only some requests will be affected, and you will need
        to adjust the `wait_time` of methods like `client.iter_messages
        <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.iter_messages>`.

        By default, all parameters are ``False``, and you need to enable
        those you plan to use by setting them to ``True``.

        You should ``except errors.TakeoutInitDelayError as e``, since this
        exception will raise depending on the condition of the session. You
        can then access ``e.seconds`` to know how long you should wait for
        before calling the method again.

        Args:
            contacts (`bool`):
                Set to ``True`` if you plan on downloading contacts.

            users (`bool`):
                Set to ``True`` if you plan on downloading information
                from users and their private conversations with you.

            chats (`bool`):
                Set to ``True`` if you plan on downloading information
                from small group chats, such as messages and media.

            megagroups (`bool`):
                Set to ``True`` if you plan on downloading information
                from megagroups (channels), such as messages and media.

            channels (`bool`):
                Set to ``True`` if you plan on downloading information
                from broadcast channels, such as messages and media.

            files (`bool`):
                Set to ``True`` if you plan on downloading media and
                you don't only wish to export messages.

            max_file_size (`int`):
                The maximum file size, in bytes, that you plan
                to download for each message with media.
