        those with the oldest message).

        Arguments
            limit (`int` | `None`):
                How many dialogs to be retrieved as maximum. Can be set to
                `None` to retrieve all dialogs. Note that this may take
                whole minutes if you have hundreds of dialogs, as Telegram
                will tell the library to slow down through a
                ``FloodWaitError``.

            offset_date (`datetime`, optional):
                The offset date to be used.

            offset_id (`int`, optional):
                The message ID to be used as an offset.

                The peer to be used as an offset.

            ignore_pinned (`bool`, optional):
                Whether pinned dialogs should be ignored or not.
                When set to `True`, these won't be yielded at all.

            ignore_migrated (`bool`, optional):
                Whether :tl:`Chat` that have ``migrated_to`` a :tl:`Channel`
                should be included or not. By default all the chats in your
                dialogs are returned, but setting this to `True` will ignore
                (i.e. skip) them in the same way official applications do.

            folder (`int`, optional):
                The folder from which the dialogs should be retrieved.

                If left unspecified, all dialogs (including those from
                folders) will be returned.

                If set to ``0``, all dialogs that don't belong to any
                folder will be returned.

                If set to a folder number like ``1``, only those from
                said folder will be returned.

                By default Telegram assigns the folder ID ``1`` to
                archived chats, so you should use that if you need
                to fetch the archived dialogs.

            archived (`bool`, optional):

            replies_are_responses: bool = True) -> custom.Conversation:
        """
        Creates a `Conversation <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation>`
        with the given entity.

        This is not the same as just sending a message to create a "dialog"
        with them, but rather a way to easily send messages and await for
        responses or other reactions. Refer to its documentation for more.

        Arguments
            entity (`entity`):
                The entity with which a new conversation should be opened.

            timeout (`int` | `float`, optional):
                The default timeout (in seconds) *per action* to be used. You
                may also override this timeout on a per-method basis. By
                default each action can take up to 60 seconds (the value of
                this timeout).

            total_timeout (`int` | `float`, optional):
                The total timeout (in seconds) to use for the whole
                conversation. This takes priority over per-action
                timeouts. After these many seconds pass, subsequent
                actions will result in ``asyncio.TimeoutError``.

            max_messages (`int`, optional):
                The maximum amount of messages this conversation will
                remember. After these many messages arrive in the
                specified chat, subsequent actions will result in
                ``ValueError``.

            exclusive (`bool`, optional):
                By default, conversations are exclusive within a single
                chat. That means that while a conversation is open in a
                chat, you can't open another one in the same chat, unless
                you disable this flag.

                If you try opening an exclusive conversation for
                a chat where it's already open, it will raise
                ``AlreadyInConversationError``.

            replies_are_responses (`bool`, optional):
                Whether replies should be treated as responses or not.

                If the setting is enabled, calls to `conv.get_response
                <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation.get_response>`
                and a subsequent call to `conv.get_reply
                <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation.get_reply>`
                will return different messages, otherwise they may return
                the same message.

                Consider the following scenario with one outgoing message,
                1, and two incoming messages, the second one replying::

                                        Hello! <1
                    2> (reply to 1) Hi!
                    3> (reply to 1) How are you?

                And the following code:

                .. code-block:: python

                    async with client.conversation(chat) as conv:
                        msg1 = await conv.send_message('Hello!')
                        msg2 = await conv.get_response()
                        msg3 = await conv.get_reply()

                With the setting enabled, ``msg2`` will be ``'Hi!'`` and
                ``msg3`` be ``'How are you?'`` since replies are also
                responses, and a response was already returned.

                With the setting disabled, both ``msg2`` and ``msg3`` will
                be ``'Hi!'`` since one is a response and also a reply.

        Returns
            A `Conversation <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation>`.

        Example
            .. code-block:: python

                # <you> denotes outgoing messages you sent
                # <usr> denotes incoming response messages
                with bot.conversation(chat) as conv:
                    # <you> Hi!
                    conv.send_message('Hi!')

                    # <usr> Hello!
                    hello = conv.get_response()

                    # <you> Please tell me your name
                    conv.send_message('Please tell me your name')

                    # <usr> ?
                    name = conv.get_response().raw_text

                    while not any(x.isalpha() for x in name):
                        # <you> Your name didn't have any letters! Try again
                        conv.send_message("Your name didn't have any letters! Try again")

                        # <usr> Human
                        name = conv.get_response().raw_text

                    # <you> Thanks Human!
