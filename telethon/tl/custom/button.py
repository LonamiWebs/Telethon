class Button:
    """
    .. note::

        This class is used to **define** reply markups, e.g. when
        sending a message or replying to events. When you access
        `Message.buttons <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.buttons>`
        they are actually `MessageButton
        <telethon.tl.custom.messagebutton.MessageButton>`,
        so you might want to refer to that class instead.

    Helper class to allow defining ``reply_markup`` when
    sending a message with inline or keyboard buttons.

    You should make use of the defined class methods to create button
    instances instead making them yourself (i.e. don't do ``Button(...)``
    but instead use methods line `Button.inline(...) <inline>` etc.

    You can use `inline`, `switch_inline`, `url`, `auth`, `buy` and `game`
    together to create inline buttons (under the message).

    You can use `text`, `request_location`, `request_phone` and `request_poll`
    together to create a reply markup (replaces the user keyboard).
    You can also configure the aspect of the reply with these.
    The latest message with a reply markup will be the one shown to the user
    (messages contain the buttons, not the chat itself).

    You **cannot** mix the two type of buttons together,
    and it will error if you try to do so.

    The text for all buttons may be at most 142 characters.
    If more characters are given, Telegram will cut the text
    to 128 characters and add the ellipsis (â€¦) character as
    the 129.
