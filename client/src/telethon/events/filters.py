Filters are functions that accept a single parameter, an :class:`~telethon.events.Event` instance, and return a :class:`bool`.

When the return value is :data:`True`, the associated :mod:`~telethon.events` handler will be invoked.

.. seealso::

    The :doc:`/concepts/updates` concept to learn to combine filters or define your own.
