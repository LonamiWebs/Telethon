<!--
Please remember that issues here should be related to the library itself and NOT your code.

Python 2 is NOT supported. Make sure you're using the latest version of Telethon before reporting:
    pip install telethon --upgrade

Some questions are okay, but make sure you've investigated enough on your own before or you will end up on the Wall of Shame:
