  ⭐️ Thanks **everyone** who has starred the project, it means a lot!

**Telethon** is Telegram client implementation in **Python 3** which uses
the latest available API of Telegram.


What is this?
-------------

Telegram is a popular messaging application. This library is meant
to make it easy for you to write Python programs that can interact
with Telegram. Think of it as a wrapper that has already done the
heavy job for you, so you can focus on developing an application.


Installing
----------

.. code:: sh

  pip3 install telethon


Creating a client
-----------------

.. code:: python

  from telethon import TelegramClient

  # These example values won't work. You must get your own api_id and
  # api_hash from https://my.telegram.org, under API Development.
  api_id = 12345
  api_hash = '0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef'

  client = TelegramClient('session_name', api_id, api_hash)
  client.start()


Doing stuff
-----------

.. code:: python

  print(client.get_me().stringify())

  client.send_message('username', 'Hello! Talking to you from Telethon')
  client.send_file('username', '/home/myself/Pictures/holidays.jpg')

  client.download_profile_photo('me')
  messages = client.get_message_history('username')
  client.download_media(messages[0])
